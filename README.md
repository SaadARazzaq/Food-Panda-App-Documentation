Welcome to the **OUR** Food Panda App Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documentation. This document outlines the functional requirements and system modeling for the Food Panda App, a food ordering and delivery platform.

## Process Model Selection

**1.1. Process Model Selection**
- An appropriate process model for the Food Panda App project is selected.

**Justification for Process Model Selection**
- Provide a clear justification for the choice of the selected process model. The chosen model should align with the project's scope, objectives, and constraints.

## System Modeling

### 2.1 Use Case Diagram
The Use Case Diagram below illustrates the high-level functionalities of the Food Panda App. Each functional requirement corresponds to a use case.

**Textual Description of High-Level and Expanded Use Cases:**
- **Use Case 01 - User Registration**: Allow users to register an account with the app, including input validation, email verification, and profile creation.
- **Use Case 02 - User Login**: Describe the user login process, including authentication and session management.
- **Use Case 03 - Search Restaurants**: Explain how users search for restaurants, specifying location, cuisine, and ratings criteria.
- **Use Case 04 - Explore Menu**: Detail how users browse restaurant menus, view item details, and prices.
- **Use Case 05 - Manage Cart**: Describe how users can add, remove, or modify items in their shopping cart.
- **Use Case 06 - Place Order**: Explain the steps involved in placing an order, including delivery preferences.
- **Use Case 07 - Track Order**: Detail how users can track their orders in real-time from kitchen to doorstep.
- **Use Case 08 - Process Payments**: Describe the payment process, including payment gateway integration.
- **Use Case 09 - View Order History**: Explain how users can view their past orders and order details.
- **Use Case 10 - Rate and Review**: Describe how users can provide ratings and reviews for restaurants.
- **Use Case 11 - Manage Profile**: Detail how users can update their profiles, including personal information and preferences.
- **Use Case 12 - Access Customer Support**: Explain how users can contact customer support for assistance.
- **Use Case 13 - Mark Favorite Restaurants**: Describe how users can mark and manage their favorite restaurants.
- **Use Case 14 - View Promotions and Offers**: Explain how users can view and access promotions and special offers.

### 2.2 Activity Diagram
Create an activity diagram to illustrate the workflow of activities within the app. This can include user interactions and system responses.

### 2.3 Sequence Diagram
For each use case (01 to 14), create sequence diagrams that show interactions between actors and the system. These diagrams will help visualize the flow of events for each use case.

### 2.4 System Sequence Diagrams (SSDs)
For each expanded use case, provide System Sequence Diagrams (SSDs) that show the messages exchanged between the actor and the system.

### 2.5 Data Flow Diagram
Create Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) for your system, including:

- **Context Level**: Show the system as a whole and its interactions with external entities.
- **Level 1**: Detail the main processes within the system.
- ![Level 0 drawio2121313](https://github.com/SaadARazzaq/Food-Panda-App-Documentation/assets/123338307/808e5a32-6ca4-431e-96bd-8ab00734b851)

- **Level 2**: Further breakdown of processes and data flows.
- ![Level 1 drawio2131313](https://github.com/SaadARazzaq/Food-Panda-App-Documentation/assets/123338307/bf0e2428-dd58-4338-b00d-21882464f90d)

### 2.6 Class Diagram

Develop a class diagram to represent the core classes and their relationships within the system. Define the entities, attributes, and associations.

This SRS document provides a detailed insight into the functional requirements and system modeling for the Food Panda App project. It serves as a comprehensive guide for developers, stakeholders, and anyone interested in understanding the project's scope and functionality.

## Conclusion

The Food Panda App Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is a critical reference for all project stakeholders. It outlines the functional requirements of the system, the selected process model, and system modeling details. This document ensures a clear and shared understanding of the project's objectives and functionality.

By following the use case diagrams, textual descriptions, activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, system sequence diagrams (SSDs), data flow diagrams, and class diagrams, stakeholders can gain a holistic view of the Food Panda App's structure and interactions.

It is important to note that this SRS document may evolve over time as the project progresses and new insights are gained. Regular updates and revisions should be made to keep this document aligned with the project's scope and objectives.
